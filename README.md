# To-Do-List

This program will help you manage your tasks. This is menu:

**1) Today's tasks**
**2) Week's tasks**
**3) All tasks**
**4) Missed tasks**
**5) Add task**
**6) Delete task**
**0) Exit**

In this program I practiced using loops, conditions and statement branches. Also I used the basics of SQLAlchemy to manage SQLite database on python.
